//Week 8 JS 5 Menu App Instructions:
//Create a menu app as seen in this weekâ€™s video. What you create is up to you as long as it meets the following requirements:
//Use at least one array.
//Use at least two classes.
//Your menu should have the options to create, view, and delete elements.
//
// For this assignment,  my first class is called Student. I created a constructor
// with the name and major. 
class Student {
    constructor(name, major) {
    this.name = name;
    this.major = major;
    }
    //I used the following method to describe the student, and used "return" to return a string that describes the student

    describe() {
    
    return `${this.name} is in ${this.major} major`;
    }

    }
//Here I defined the Dept class
    class Dept {
    constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.students = [];
    }
    //Below I used a method to add a student to the department
    addStudent(student) {
        //the code below checks if the argument is an instance of Student
    if (student instanceof Student) {
    this.students.push(student); //Here we add a student to the array
    } else {
        //below we throw an error if the argument is not a student instance
    throw new Error(`You can only add an instance of Student. Argument is not a student: ${student}`);
    }
    }
    //Below we use this method to describe the department
    describe() {
        //// We Return a string describing the department and the number of students
    return `${this.name} has ${this.students.length} students.`;
    }
